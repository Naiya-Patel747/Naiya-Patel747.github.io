									<h1>About Manek Chowk</h1>
                                        <p>It is named after saint Maneknath who interrupted and helped Ahmed Shah I build Bhadra Fort in 1411. This bustling open square near the center of the city functions as a vegetable market in the morning and a jewellery market in the afternoon, the second biggest in India, at an apparently 3 million rupees of annual turnover./p>
                                    <h2>Food Streets</h2>
