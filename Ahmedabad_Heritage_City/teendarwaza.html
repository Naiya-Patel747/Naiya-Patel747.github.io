									<h1>About Teen Darwaza</h1>
									<h2>History</h2>
                                        <p>The Teen Darwaza was an egress from Bhadra Fort to the eastward. The gateway has three arches which led into a large enclosure, forming the outer courtyard of the palace called Maidan Shah in past, with a fountain and raised terrace in the centre.</p>
                                    <h2>Architecture</h2>
        								<p>The roadway in the central opening is 17 feet wide, and that of each side arch is 13 feet wide. It has highly decorated buttresses on the faces of piers between the arches. The height of the arches is twenty-five feet. The terrace on the top of the gateway was formerly roofed over.</p>
