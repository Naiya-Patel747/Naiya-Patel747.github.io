									<h1>More About Ahmedabad</h1>
									<h2>History</h2>
                                        <p>The area around Ahmedabad has been inhabited since the 11th century, when it was known as Ashaval. At that time, Karna, the Chaulukya  ruler of Anhilwara , waged a successful war against the Bhil king of Ashaval, and established a city called Karnavati on the banks of the Sabarmati.</p>
                                    <h2>Population</h2>
        								<p>At the 2011 Census of India Ahmedabad had a population of 5,633,927, making it the fifth most populous city in India.</p>
    								<h2>Geography</h2>
        								<p>Ahmedabad lies at 23.03°N 72.58°E in western India at 53 metres (174 ft) above sea level on the banks of the Sabarmati river, in north-central Gujarat. It covers an area of 505 km2 (195 sq mi). Three lakes lie within the city's limits—Kankaria, Vastrapur and Chandola. Kankaria, in the neighbourhood of Maninagar, is an artificial lake developed by the Sultan of Gujarat, Qutb-ud-din, in 1451. Ahmedabad is divided by the Sabarmati into two physically distinct eastern and western regions.</p>
